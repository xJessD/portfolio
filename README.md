# Portfolio Project

## Intro
Hello! Welcome to my portfolio project. You can see it [live here](https://xjessd.github.io/).

This is a showcase my skills / tech stack that I have learnt in my first few weeks at my _Nology course. This has been created with HTML and CSS. 


## Some notes
This is a starting point for a portfolio that will be worked on throughout the training. 

The initial projects in my portfolio are some olders things I have worked on prior to _Nology. It includes some blog designs I have designed and coded for myself in the past, as well as some design work for my uni magazine and business cards.
